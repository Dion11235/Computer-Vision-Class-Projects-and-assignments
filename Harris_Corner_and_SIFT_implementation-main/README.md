# Harris_Corner_and_SIFT_implementation

In this project we will take two images of the same object from two different angles and will
check if we can match them.For matching two images we have to match them with respect
to the corners because comparing corners in any two images is easier that any other points
on those images.So in this project we will discuss the procedures to **identify those corners
and extract special features with the help of Harris Corners and SIFT with which we can
match two image frames**. As implementation of SIFT is patented and not open for public use, this 
implementation holds value.

- all the implementations can be found in `student_code.py` and all the experiments in `proj2.ipynb`.
- all the matches for the datas in `data` folder , can be found in `results` folder.
- all the theoretical details about this project can be found in the project report `HarrisCornerSIFT.pdf`
