# Hybrid_Image

The objective of this project is to **create a hybrid image by using the low frequency and high frequency component of two different images**. 
A hybrid image is the sum of a low-pass filtered version of the first image and
a high-pass filtered version of a second image. The cut-off frequency
is a parameter of the filter which has been used to control the high-pass and
low-pass frequency content of the images.
